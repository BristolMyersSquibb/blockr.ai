# EVALUATION BY CLAUDE
# ============================================================

evaluation:
  run_01_a:
    correct: false
    reason: "API connection error - no tool calls made, no result"

  run_01_b:
    correct: true
    pct_sum: 1.00
    reason: "All requirements met. Fixed syntax error on retry, pct sums to 1.0"

  run_02_a:
    correct: true
    pct_sum: 1.00
    reason: "All requirements met. Single tool call, efficient."

  run_02_b:
    correct: true
    pct_sum: 1.00
    reason: "All requirements met. Struggled with head()/str() not available, but succeeded."

  run_03_a:
    correct: true
    pct_sum: 1.00
    reason: "All requirements met."

  run_03_b:
    correct: false
    reason: "Only used data_tool, never called eval_tool. No validated result."

summary:
  variant_a: "2/3 correct"
  variant_b: "2/3 correct"

  observations: |
    - Run 1A failed due to API error (not model issue)
    - Run 3B failed because LLM was satisfied with data_tool preview
    - Variant B takes 3-4x longer (32-48s vs 10-13s)
    - Variant B uses more tool calls (3-4 vs 1)
    - When both succeed, results are correct
