  For each cylinder group (cyl):
  1. Rank cars by mpg within each group (best mpg = rank 1)
  2. Add a column "mpg_rank" with this rank
  3. Add a column "efficiency_class" based on the rank:
     - rank 1-2: "top"
     - rank 3-4: "middle"
     - rank 5+: "bottom"
  4. Calculate "pct_above_group_avg": how much each car mpg exceeds its group average, as a percentage
  
  Keep columns: cyl, mpg, hp, mpg_rank, efficiency_class, pct_above_group_avg
  Sort by cyl, then by mpg_rank.
  Round pct_above_group_avg to 1 decimal place.
