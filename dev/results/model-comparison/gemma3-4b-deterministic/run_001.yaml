  Calculate a "relative_efficiency" score for each car:
  
  1. First, calculate each car mpg relative to overall mean mpg (not group mean!)
     relative_mpg = (mpg - overall_mean_mpg) / overall_mean_mpg * 100
  
  2. Then, for each cyl group separately:
     - Rank cars by this relative_mpg (highest = rank 1)
     - Calculate "pct_rank": what percentile is this car within its cyl group?
       (rank 1 = 100th percentile, last rank = ~0th percentile)
  
  Keep: cyl, mpg, hp, relative_mpg, rank_in_group, pct_rank
  Sort by cyl, then rank_in_group.
  Round to 1 decimal place.
  
  Note: relative_mpg uses OVERALL mean, but ranking is within GROUPS.
