  Create a cross-tabulation summary table:
  - One row per gear value (3, 4, 5)
  - Columns: gear, cyl_4, cyl_6, cyl_8, total
  - cyl_4, cyl_6, cyl_8 = count of cars with that gear AND cylinder combination
  - total = sum of counts across cylinder groups for that gear
  - Fill any missing combinations with 0
  - Sort by gear
  
  Expected output structure (4 columns + gear):
    gear  cyl_4  cyl_6  cyl_8  total
       3      1      2     12     15
       4      8      4      0     12
       5      2      1      2      5
