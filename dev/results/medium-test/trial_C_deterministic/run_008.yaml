  Group by cyl and calculate:
  1. mean_mpg: average mpg for each group
  2. mean_hp: average hp for each group
  3. count: number of cars in each group
  
  Then add:
  4. pct_of_total: count as percentage of total cars (should sum to 100)
  5. efficiency_ratio: mean_mpg divided by mean_hp (higher = more efficient)
  
  Sort by efficiency_ratio descending.
  Round all numeric columns to 2 decimal places.
