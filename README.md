## Overview

`blockr.ai` provides AI-powered blocks for the `blockr.core` framework.
It enables integration with various AI services and models to enhance
data analysis workflows through natural language interactions.

## Features

- Natural language powered plot creation through `new_llm_plot_block()`
- AI-assisted data transformations through `new_llm_transform_block()`
- Integration with OpenAIâ€™s GPT models
- Interactive blocks that can be composed with other blockr components

## Installation

You can install the development version of blockr.ai from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("cynkra/blockr.ai")
```

## Usage

`blockr.ai` extends the `blockr.core` framework with AI capabilities.

### Examples

``` r
library(blockr.core)
library(blockr.ai)

serve(
  new_llm_plot_block(),
  data = list(`1` = iris)
)

serve(
  new_llm_transform_block(),
  data = list(`1` = iris)
)

serve(
  new_board(
    blocks = blocks(
      a = new_dataset_block("iris"),
      b = new_llm_plot_block(
        "Createa a scatterplot of Sepal.Length against Sepal.Width.",
        paste(
          "ggplot2::ggplot(dataset_1) +",
          "  ggplot2::geom_point(",
          "    ggplot2::aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length)",
          "  )",
          sep = "\n"
        )
      )
    ),
    links = links("a", "b")
  )
)
```
